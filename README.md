# E-commerce_Sales_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project reviews the performance of an e-commerce business in Nigeria from April to September 2021 (Q2–Q3 2021).
Over this period, the business generated ₦28.8M in revenue across 3,128 orders, with sales spread across five key categories: Airlines, Betting, Cable, Internet, and Utilities.
The analysis highlights seasonal peaks in May and September, driven by increased betting activity, higher travel demand, and cable subscriptions.
